Laser Cutting with Corel Draw
A laser cutter uses computer numerical control (CNC) to read graphic information from your computer and cut or engrave it into material using a laser beam. The laser optics are usually set up to direct the laser beam from one angle (usually from the top down). It moves along an X and a Y axis.

Whether the laser cuts or engraves the material depends on the way in which the file is set up—it can run the laser using raster engraving and/or vector cutting.

Raster engraving: Raster images are used for laser engraving (not cutting). Raster engraving creates highly detailed graphic images. The laser head moves back and forth engraving a series of dots to form the image from the digital file (like an old printer). Raster engraving is used for all types of images and visuals (logos, photos, text, etc.). Basically anything that does not involve cutting.
Vector cutting: Vector files are basically line drawings consisting of a continuous path. They would usually be used to cut completely through the material. To vector cut, you need to make sure that lines are no bigger than 0.001 inch heaviness. All lines in a file get registered by the laser and are cut. So make sure that your file does not contain any hidden lines (covered by another shape) or any type of marking.
Files for this can basically be prepared in any program that supports these two types of graphic formats (such as Corel Draw, Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop, SketchUp, Microsoft Paint, etc.).

We’ll now walk you through what such files might look like in Corel Draw on a PC, Illustrator on a Mac, and also how you can translate a 3D model of a box in Rhino to flattened 2D files for laser cutting.

There are lots of other box models on Thingiverse, Instructables, and other sites. So if you want to use a different box model, try looking up models for laser cutting online.
